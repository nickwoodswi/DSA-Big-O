function doubleArrayValues(array) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        array[i] *= 2;
    }
    return array;
}

2 = O(n) -> for loop fires for every n
3 = O(1) -> Value is singular, operation is performed once
4 = O(1) -> Value is singular, operation is performed once

BigO here is O(n*(O(1)) + 1).
